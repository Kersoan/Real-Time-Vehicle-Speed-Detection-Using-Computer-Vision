# **Real-Time Vehicle Speed Detection Using Computer Vision**

This project uses OpenCV and Python to detect moving vehicles in a video feed and estimate their speed in real time.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Detects vehicles from a video or webcam using Background Subtraction (MOG2).

Assigns unique IDs to track each vehicle across frames.

Calculates vehicle speed based on pixel displacement and time difference.

Displays speed in km/h above each detected vehicle.

Works with recorded videos (traffic.mp4) or a live webcam feed.
